Learning the gitogoly
Backgound:
Started programming in BASIC in the early 1970's.
Worked with early PDP-8/F model.
It used a front panel interface, a paper-tape reader and, a teletype printer with paper-tape punch.
Later studied Pascal and FORTRAN....Visual BASIC, C++.
Now, after many years of virtually no programming, I am learning git and Python.
Lots different in the new programming platforms from the oldies I learned.
Interested in data science, cryptographic alogorithms and protocols.
I also want to learn other languages, eg R....
